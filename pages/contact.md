If you have questions that aren't answered in these pages, if you run into problems that you don't know how to solve, or you want to get involved and don't know how, please reach out.
See the [Developers](/developers/) section for more background on the internals of icepack and how to contribute.

**GitHub**: Icepack is developed publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/icepack/icepack).
If you have a bug to report or a new feature to request, please don't hesitate to [raise an issue](https://github.com/icepack/icepack/issues) on our project page.

**Slack**: A lot of the routine development discussion takes place on the Firedrake slack workspace.
This workspace is open to all but you'll need to request an invitation.
See [this page](https://firedrakeproject.org/contact.html) for instructions.
Once you have access you can then join the \#icepack channel.
If you're using icepack regularly, this is where we'll announce important changes like bug fixes or new features.

**Email**: You can email the lead developer of icepack, Daniel Shapero, at the address listed on his staff webpage [here](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/people/investigators/daniel-shapero/).
