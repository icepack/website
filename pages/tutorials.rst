This page is for you if you're just starting out with icepack and you want to learn how to use it.
These tutorials demonstate all of the functionality of the library that you will need to set up simulations of glacier flow.
The pages linked below are all rendered from Jupyter notebooks that come with the icepack source distribution under the demo/ directory.
You can and should run all of this code yourself.
We'll assume that you have a working installation of both Firedrake and icepack, that you've set up a Jupyter kernel for Firedrake, and that you're able to run the tutorial notebooks in the demo/ directory of the icepack source tree.
If you haven't done that yet, see the installation page for instructions.

The goal of the tutorials is to get you off the ground.
If you already have a good grasp of what icepack does and you want to use it to solve new and interesting problems, you can look at our collection of how-to guides.
Those pages will show you the ingredients for more realistic simulations that you might use in original research for publication in peer-reviewed journal articles.
