First of all, thank you for thinking about contributing to this project!
Icepack is free and open-source software developed for the express purpose of serving the glaciological community.
In the long term, **this project will only succeed if we can engage that community, including users like you, in the development process.**

Most of the routine coding and new development occurs on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/icepack/icepack/>`_.
This is where you can go to file bug reports, request new features, and submit new demos or code.
Please see the pages in the sidebar for more detailed information about how to get involved in the development of icepack.
The pages on the right are ordered roughly as a "hierarchy of needs", the lowest being how you can ask for help from the developers, the highest being how you can develop useful and readable code yourself.
If you have a question that isn't answered in these pages, feel free to `get in touch </contact/>`_.

**Suggesting new code**: This page will describe how you can give feedback to the developers of icepack about changes that you think we should make, either to fix problems that exist right now or to add new features that aren't there yet.

**Submitting new code**: This page describes the process for including new code that you've written into icepack.
We encourage you to add new features or help us improve existing ones.
When you do, you're a developer now.

**Writing correct code**: This page describes how we test the code in icepack.
Testing scientific software is necessary but very challenging; simulation codes can be wrong in subtle ways that are very hard to detect.

**Writing readable code**: Writing new routines that do what you expect correctly is one thing; writing code that is easy to understand and digest for other developers is quite another.
This page describes our philosophy around how to not just write correct code but also write what we think is "good" code.

**Maintaining code**: How to work on code with other people and not drive yourself totally insane.
