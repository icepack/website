First of all, thank you for thinking about contributing to this project!
Icepack is free and open-source software developed for the express purpose of serving the glaciological community.
In the long term, **this project will only succeed if we can engage that community, including users like you, in the development process.**

Most of the routine coding and new development occurs on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/icepack/icepack/>`_.
This is where you can go to file bug reports, request new features, and submit new demos or code.
Please see the links in the sidebar for more detailed information about how to get involved in the development of icepack.
If you have a question that isn't answered in these pages, feel free to `get in touch </contact/>`_.
