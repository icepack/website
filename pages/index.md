Welcome to the homepage for *icepack*, a Python library for modeling the flow of glaciers and ice sheets.
Icepack is developed at the University of Washington by a team of researchers and students and our main goal is to make a tool that will be useful for every glaciologist, whether or not you're an expert in modeling.
